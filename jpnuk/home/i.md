## About us

Founded in 2002, JPNUK is committed to promoting the recognition, dignity, and equal rights of all humans as a foundation for peace and freedom. We stand in solidarity with indigenous peoples worldwide, in particular the rights of Jumma people in the Hill Tracts of Bangladesh (Rangamati, Khagrachari, and Bandarban), who face human rights violations. Our campaign focuses on preventing such injustices, advocating for: civil, political, socio-economic and cultural rights of indigenous communities both in the Hill Tracts and abroad. By exposing oppression and demanding action from governments and international bodies, we seek to hold perpetrators accountable and ensure compliance with international human rights laws. We work to build a network of like-minded people and organizations, appealing to global leaders to end human rights violations against minorities and indigenous peoples.
