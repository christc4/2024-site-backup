# why

There is nothing i detest more than enforcing a man-made national curiculum dictating what poems students  must study and the quality of one's disection affects their passing grade

There is fan-fiction and then there is erecting man-made examinations for your fan-fiction

I never thought I would write poetry

Poetry isn't meant to be laid on the operating table and disected,

But it is a nice way of coping 

My favourite poem currently is [I'll never love Thee more](https://daypoems.net/poems/327.html), I wish one day I can write like that
