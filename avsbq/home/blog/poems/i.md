## Misplaced jewel

You are a misplaced jewel,

A treasure chest lost to sea,

I grab at you with my pincer claw,

But therein is no such bead,

No pearl, or jewel to catch a hefty fee,

But piles of sand turn me a fool,

So I grovel back to my hovel,

Yet herein, I find no feed

## Judas Tree (unfinished)

If for a day joy masters me, [(1)](#bc-1)

And misery takes it's leave,

\- Oh Judas tree!, Oh great absantee!

My company has left me to grieve

Who else to nurse a grudge and tend a wound?

## My Dead Tongue 

I await a day when words drop from the sky,

Like guinea fowl, with nowhere to hide,

When no mortal can press glass to cheek,

Hearing words of familiar speak,

I await a day when words drop from the sky,

When two deaf ears beg for a chide,

And two guilty hands beg to be tried

## Great Hoarder (unfinished!)

To say one person brought on such a mess,

For as little as a fly stirs up the oceans,

Great hoarder, 

As quietly as I cleared out your wares,

And set aflame your spoils,

Did you sense the disbalance

Great hoarder, 

How a criminal hates their clue [1](#gh1)

Does a dog not hide its bone?

## My Lord

My heart is weak and not worth saving,  

But that is my Lord's favourite craving, [1](#ml1)

My Lord can pull out all the stops,

If a show needs saving,

## Oh Artist

Oh Artist,

Take a tinderbox to all the world's art,

Place a powderkeg under every library,

Lay dynamite below the feet of saints

Then oh artist, will I love thee

Oh Artist,

Let me see your holy book, one closer look

Oh Artist,

Take down that false cross and rid me of those chains,

Distruub your dead

ill take your vase and splinter it into a thousand heirlooms and scatter it in the wind

and deliver you to the wind

and watch as i tear it to shredsw

can mortal men through virture, retrace its pages

Then oh artist, will I love thee

my terror will calm a crying child

Deliver you to St. Fawkes
