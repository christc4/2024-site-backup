# Worthless

Not Priceless, Worthless. 

While sorting throgh an old bag of coins, and weeding out all the foreign ones. I jangled the metals in my hand.

Everything I'm holding in my palm is worthless. Utterly worthless.

In high-school economics, we were taught the four basic functions of money.

Money is a...

- Store of value
- Medium of exchange
- Unit of account
- Standard  of deferred payment

But wait... How could the people who created my course's specification forget the most important thing about money.

It's a religious belief.
