### <a name=commute>Commute</a>

Person 1's route to work consists of lush gardens. Windows, purposefully, designed for maximum light. 

Person 2's traipses through  a sovietesque concrete jungle, there are no gardens, save for the weeds and lichens growing in pavement crack.

When I had to travel to college each and every day, I had the privilege of being more or less in Person 1's shoes. I got to take a leisurely stroll through the carefully maintained park grounds of Queen Elizabeth Olypmic Park each and every day. My peers, I assume had to board early commuter trains...

When I visited Bangladesh, mosquito galore!

## How to prevent mosquito problem?

Kill at larval stage...

- drain/fill breeding site
- screening/covering water tanks
- dry out irrigation channel weekly, thus interrupting life-cycle of mosquito
- stock water sites with fish, which eat larvae, said fish can also be food source e.g. 'grass carp'

Without directly seeking mosqsuitios to execute you can do all of the above, now take that and extrapolate it to some other facets of life...

Lidis  didn't start appearing on German steins (German traditonal beermugs) until the Bubonic plague swept through Europe (in the 1300s), where insects appeared in their millions and were attracted to the sweet smelling beer. 

The government decreed that all drinking establishments had to cover their stoneware with lids to prevent spread of disease.
