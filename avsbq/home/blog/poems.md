[Misplaced Jewel](#misplaced-jewel)

## <a name=misplaced-jewel>Misplaced jewel</a>

You are a misplaced jewel,

A treasure chest lost to sea,

I grab at you with my pincer claw,

But therein is no such bead,

No pearl, or jewel to catch a hefty fee,

But piles of sand turn me a fool,

So I grovel back to my hovel,

Yet herein, I find no feed

## Blackest chill

If for a day joy masters me, [(1)](#bc-1)

And misery takes it's leave,

Who shall I share this joy with?

Oh leave me be you whims and wiles

My heart is a jackhammer

My rear welded to my seat

Horrible hammer blows tick find source
