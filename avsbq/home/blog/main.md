##  <a name=agit-prop>Agit Prop</a>

2024/12/27

For every solutionist worth their salt there are a dime-a-dozen if not more agitation person(s), they rile up their audiences leaving them in a frenzied state over often inconsequential and sometimes faraway events

Georgi Plekhanov, dubbed the 'father' of Russian Marxism, wrote how propagandists present *many ideas* to *one or a few people* whereas agitators present *only one or a few ideas* to a *mass of people*. 

To which he describes agitation as using

- slogans and half-truths
- to exploit public grievances
- thereby molding public opinion and mobilizing support

Vladimir Lenin explained in a 1902 pamphlet, _What Is to be Done_,  his beliefs on the role of the propagandist and agitator

- Propagandists work with media
- Agitators, for their part, act on emotional levels, rousing people to take an interest in social ills

Agit-prop lives on from soviet-times, its spiritual descendents being the numerous political pundits littering your feed after any major politicism whose long-winded rants while sometimes dropping pithy remarks only tangentially touch on 'possible' solutions. 

### Addendum

So agitation propaganda really is like casting spells onto the masses, the spells being hard-coded signals to your anger receptors. Rule by rumourville

##  <a name=autism>Autism</a>

2024/11/09

Being on the 'verge, brink and edge' are scenarios you'd be hardpressed to find a low-functiioning autist *stay* in

Autists as we all know are super sensitive to stimuli, too much will overwhelm their senses.

Where autists differ with their non-autistic brethren is the freshhold of stimuli one can tolerate before thrasing/fleeing

Domesticated man is adapted in the sense, he can tolerate, aclimatize and perhaps even justify why he willingly chooses to remain  in a stressful environment. Of course, _rational_ man is acutely aware of the push and pull factors

Yet, his counterpart is much more immune to such coaxing

_So why state the obvious?_

Lack of stimuli will also provoke an autistic person. They will exit a boring classroom

It is viewed 'normal' for an autist to seek the path of least resistance because they are 'special' but if _rational_ man  was to do the same they would face a lot of criticism

Due to how society is structured, it is and cannot be Edenic, humans had to apopt non-autistic traits

Autism is the default state of mankind. Autistic people are closer to bearing the same scent animals smelled upon Adam in the Garden

Low functioning autists without any knowledge of good or evil have a more Edenic moral compass

##  <a name=blind-spots>Blind Spots</a>

2024/11/09

In the novel _Gulliver's Travels_ there exists a people called the [Struldbruggs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Struldbrugg) who are immortals but the gift of immortality brings with it one downside... That is, elderly and young can no longer communicate. What once was a bridge between the two had drifted far beyond the straits of intelligibility

One of our greatest blind spots as humans is the collapsing cultural bridge that once spanned generations. Each generation we lose our _common frames of reference_ a la cultural touchpoints. The Struldbruggs' immortality creates a chasm - language that once binded them dissolve into alienness

What we then know of the past can become airbrushed and idealised or commentators fail to enlarge upon particular sections, thus leaving blind spots about the true texture of the past

Just as the Struldbruggs are blighted with a unique blindness to their descendant's language, we too develop blind spots over time, particularly when looking back on the past with rose-tinted lense

When telling tales of a once sunnier past, we often airbrush or fail to enlarge upon critically important sections

The true cost of blind spots

Our memories, stripped of nuance, blind us to the full reality of past generations, making it harder to fully connect across time

## <a name=internet-landmines>Internet Landmines</a>

In prehistoric times, evils  forces like centralization, censorship and moral degeneracy hadn't fully seeded itself in the web.  You could've treated the web like a library waiting for readers to come flocking in - the only invisible hand moving you towards different items on a bookshelf shelf was your own interest.

This blog post is dedicated to solutions that sidestep pasts said landmines [in theory]. 

Example 1.  [_The Ultimate Way of Browsing Channels_](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/voidrice/pull/1320)

 As the author puts it, _"No browsers, accounts, distractions, crappy algorithm and recommendations, advertisements, sponsors, intros, outros, fillers or empty spaces. We eliminate them all"_

## <a name=nobody-knows-english>Nobody Knows English</a>

Words are troublesome.

Centuries of medieval scholasticism, academic rigor, cultural revolutions have rendered many words,  _utterly useless_ 

Words can [1]

- encompass a totality/particular
- be vehicles for concepts
- have one or many referrants

Words have become so useless, we need to _justify_ even invoking them, despite many of them being boiled to their lowest common denominator

_"it's X, in the sense that..."_

At the end of the day, words mean whatever the majority and thus the 'brokers of power' determine them to be

Think of these 'sounds' as a rolling ball of bubblegum, which continuously gets new things tacked onto it

## Addendum

This [vid](/pix/ww1.webm) is a funny misunderstanding of 'greatness'

## <a name=offloading-parenting>Offloading Parenting</a>

2024/11/11

Offloading parenting is the transferral of father/motherly duties onto others. The closest word in modern exchange is  'outsourcing'

 _where you move internal operations to a third party_

At its core, imagine it as passing the parental torch onto total strangers.

### Scenario A

<span style="font-size: 12px;">*Note to reader*: I only draw upon 'fitness' since its a common example. Real 'fit'ness is going on hikes with your kids and finding cool rocks or bugs</span>

A dad never begins a fitness regimen with his son. Young and impressionable, he becomes totally enraptured by an influencer promising them an incredible return rate - all the while peddling a harmful ideology - and thus their working out stems from such influences

Go ahead and rightfully label their wellspring of motivation as a:

- grifter
- con-artist
- snake-oil salesman

Your points no matter how true often rings null and void

### Scenario B

Every child has a natural affinity to games,

That doesn't mean a parent has to do his homework on every triple A title and grind hours in a battle royale. Knowing about board gamees, dice games, card games, indie games, story games, point and click, RTS doesn't hurt you. By forgoing this bonding experience with them, transfers this to an online community or YouTuber..

### What isn't offloading?

You'd be right to point out, not everyone is a physicist, would I be offloading my parental duties by hiring a Physics tutor to teach my child? Let's touch back on the definition of outsourcing,

> to move core operations to a third party

 Keep a breadth of wise, knowledgeable friends. Friends that are good at manual work and those that are more scientifically suited, then its okay to offload the hard stuff

With friends, you can vet them, with teachers and tutors not so much. Of course everyone has skeletons in their closet. But I like to think our friends are on our side. 

## <a name=non-foods-and-food>Non-Foods & Food</a>

2025/1/15

Despite their status as the darling of humanities sustenance, many foods are not food.

Whereas raw-meat is the boogeyman,

hadzabe cornmeal they're geetting a bad deal with trading hooney

food that fueled a nation,  yes when there are no wild animals and because you are in a war and lower classes do not hunt...

You will be hardpressed to find organs in a butcher shop atleast in the UK

## <a name=tacked-on-masculinity>Tacked on Masculinity</a>

In nature, men are inherently masculine.

There is nothing masculine about the gym, combat-sports, martial arts, sports, cars etc.

As children, the herd mentality ostracizes or finds you weird for not liking the above, this disillusions men with who they are

Cars require roads, government planning and destruction of nature
Sports, is something you would do with a child to have fun
