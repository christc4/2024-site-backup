1/4 lamb's liver is 1.65 (GBP) at my butcher's. I eat it raw and by itself can satiate me for 2 days. I rarely eat any muscle meat, it's a lot more expensive and the opportunity cost both cost-wise and nutrient-wise are organs

 
If I have money left over, I'll usually buy sashimi. In price and taste order, first is salmon, then tuna, followed by scallops. But I love them all. I also eat smoked salmon usually accompanied with cheese.

I sip fruit juice or kefir throughout the day.

Everything above is my ideal pattern of eating and causes me to feel most optimal. I'd like to supplement in brains.

The girl who prepares miso soup at a restaurant is pretty, so I have found myself drinking it a lot lately.
