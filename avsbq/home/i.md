I'm Christos, the 20yo webmaster responsible for this wood-glued site. This is my trench for when my friends bathe in public fountains. Due to spells of despondency several pages may be half-baked.

I have A LOT of pictures I want to post here, of tech, nature and misc. - I haven't even scratched the backlog's surface
